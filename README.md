## Magic Proof of Concept

This is a basic auth test using Magic "Hello World (React)" template, wich allows you to log in using only your email and a "magic link" and grants you a wallet address.

To start the project, just add you Magic publishable key to your `.env` file and then run:

```
yarn install

yarn start
```

If you open the browser console, you will see the `userMetadata` that Magic returns.
